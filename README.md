# Git Pages Landing Page
**End of week code review project for Epicodus, 01.08.2016**
### By Anna Lawley


## Description
This is a landing page for my gh-pages page, done as part of the Epicodus Intro to Programming Week 1 code review challenge. Per the assignment, it contains my name, an about me section with an image, a variety of HTML tags, bootstrap styling, and a custom CSS stylesheet.

## Setup
Clone this repository and open index.html in a modern  web browser of your choice.


## Technologies Used
Bootstrap  
CSS

##Known Bugs
Slight bit of delay lag for the link buttons on the carousel to expand down on slides 2 and 3 when switching from the previous (but not next) slide. Has to do with the length of text in the slides.
